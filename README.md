# Do You Have Mamba Mentality?
![insert image tag here]

## Concept 
A time-coded quiz was developed using a combination of multiple-choice questions. The app is run in the browser and features dynamically updated code. For this particular assignment, I chose to pick a subject that focused on one of my passions -- The Los Angeles Lakers and the late Kobe Bryant's accomplishments that he brought to the NBA and entertainment world. 

## Usage

The user is posed with 8 individual multipe-choice questions about Kobe's career and successes outside of the NBA. The user must answer each question within 24 seconds do demonstrate whether they have "Mamba Mentality". 

## Challenges

When initially completing this assignment, coding the 24 second clock continues to be a challenge but one I will keep working to accomplish. 

## Successes

What I enjoyed the most in working on this project was choosing relevant images and engaging and dynamic features to keep the user engaged in the game. Bootstrap and dynamic CSS styling helped me to achieve a polished user interface that visitors to this site would enjoy.
