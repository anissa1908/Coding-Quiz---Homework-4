# Coding-Quiz---Homework-4
The Coding Quiz assignment illustrates all of the concepts and methods we have learned about Javascript.

We have been tasked to complete a coding assessment, which is typically a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive challenges and build a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
